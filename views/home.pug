    b Background:
    | The logistic map is a simple nonlinear difference equation that models the population of a species with the passing of each generation (or similar fixed length of time).  In the above equation
    i x
    | represents the ratio of the population to its maximum possible value, the first term (
    i rx
    | ) represents reproduction, the second term (-
    i rx
    sup 2
    | ) represents starvation, and the growth-rate parameter
    i r
    | is between 0 and 4.  Despite the equation's simplicity and depending upon the value of
    i r
    | , the solutions can be remarkably complex, giving rise to period doubling and chaos. The table below summarizes some of this.  See
